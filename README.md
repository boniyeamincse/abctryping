## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- Node.js 16+
- MySQL or SQLite

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/abctyping.git
cd abctyping

# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations and seeders (includes test users)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Compile assets
npm run dev

# Start development server
php artisan serve
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Development
npm run dev
php artisan serve

# Production build
npm run build
```

### 🧪 Testing Credentials

The application includes pre-seeded test users for all roles:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Super Admin | superadmin@abctyping.com | SuperAdmin123! |
| Institution Admin | institution@abctyping.com | Institution123! |
| Teacher | teacher@abctyping.com | Teacher123! |
| Regular User | user@abctyping.com | User123! |

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Login with any of the above credentials
2. The system will automatically redirect you to the appropriate dashboard based on your role
3. Verify that the navigation shows only the links appropriate for your role
4. Test accessing different dashboard routes to ensure role middleware protection works
5. Try accessing other roles' dashboards - you should receive a 403 Forbidden error

### Role-Based Access Testing

**Super Admin Testing:**
- Should see: Dashboard, Institutions, Users, Packages, System Settings
- Should access: `/dashboard/super-admin`
- Test URL: `/dashboard/institution-admin` (should be blocked)

**Institution Admin Testing:**
- Should see: Dashboard, Batches, Students, Reports
- Should access: `/dashboard/institution-admin`
- Test URL: `/dashboard/teacher` (should be blocked)

**Teacher Testing:**
- Should see: Dashboard, My Batches, My Students
- Should access: `/dashboard/teacher`
- Test URL: `/dashboard/user` (should be blocked)

**User Testing:**
- Should see: Dashboard, Levels, Practice, Badges, Certificates
- Should access: `/dashboard/user`
- Test URL: `/dashboard/super-admin` (should be blocked)

## 🔐 Authentication & Roles

### User Roles
The application supports four user roles:

1. **user** - Regular student/learner
2. **teacher** - Educator with student management
3. **institution_admin** - Institution management
4. **super_admin** - System administrator

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Middleware**: `RoleMiddleware` protects routes based on user roles
- **Navigation**: Dynamic menu system shows appropriate links for each role
- **Dashboard**: Each role has a customized dashboard experience

### Adding Roles to Users
Users can be assigned roles through:
- Database seeder
- Admin interface (for super admins)
- Direct database update

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:

- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu for small screens
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes
