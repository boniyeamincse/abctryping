3. Technology Stack
Backend

Language: PHP 8.2+

Framework: Laravel 10/11

Database: MySQL / MariaDB (recommended), or PostgreSQL

ORM: Eloquent

Queue: Laravel Queue (Redis / Database driver)

Mail: Laravel Mail (for verification, reset, notifications)

Frontend (inside Laravel)

To keep things simple and fast, we’ll use:

Blade templates for views

Tailwind CSS for modern UI

Alpine.js or small JS for frontend interactivity

Optionally Livewire later for dynamic components (typing area, dashboards)

You can later upgrade to Inertia + Vue/React if needed, but Blade + Tailwind is enough to start.

4. Modules List (Laravel-wise)

5. Short DB Outline (Very High Level)

Just the main tables (no full schema, just overview):

users (id, name, email, password, role, institution_id nullable, …)

institutions (id, name, address, contact_email, …)

batches (id, institution_id, name, start_date, …)

batch_user (batch_id, user_id)

levels (id, name, order, description, is_free)

steps (id, level_id, order, title, description, min_wpm, min_accuracy, ...)

exercises (id, step_id, text, time_limit_seconds, ...)

step_progress (id, user_id, step_id, status, best_wpm, best_accuracy, attempt_count, ...)

exercise_attempts (id, user_id, exercise_id, wpm, accuracy, errors, duration, ...)

badges (id, code, name, description, image_path, ...)

user_badges (id, user_id, badge_id, awarded_at, ...)

certificates (id, user_id, level_id or type, certificate_code, pdf_path, issued_at, ...)

packages (id, name, description, price, duration_days, included_levels JSON/relationship, ...)

subscriptions (id, user_id, package_id, start_date, end_date, status, ...)

payments (id, user_id, package_id, amount, status, gateway, transaction_id, ...)

6. Step-by-Step Development Plan (with Frontend Focus)
PHASE 0 – Project Setup

Create Laravel project

laravel new abctyping


Configure .env:

DB connection

Mail settings

Run migrations (start with default users, password_resets, etc.).

Install frontend tools:

Tailwind CSS

Configure vite.config.js

PHASE 1 – Auth & Roles

Backend:

Use Laravel Breeze or Laravel UI for auth scaffolding.

Add role column to users table (enum: super_admin, institution_admin, teacher, user).

Create middleware:

RoleMiddleware that checks auth()->user()->role.

Frontend (Blade):

Login page (Blade + Tailwind).

Registration page.

Basic layout file: layouts/app.blade.php

Nav bar (Home, Dashboard, Logout)

Show different menus for different roles.

PHASE 2 – Levels, Steps & User Progress

Backend:

Create models + migrations for levels, steps, exercises, step_progress, exercise_attempts.

Controllers (e.g. LevelController, StepController, ExerciseController).

Routes (web.php):

GET /levels

GET /levels/{level}

GET /steps/{step}

POST /steps/{step}/complete (after typing test).

Frontend:

Level list page:

Show all levels with progress (for logged-in user).

Indicate locked/unlocked for paid levels.

Step detail page:

Show lesson text, exercise description, “Start Exercise” button.

Step progress display:

Show if step is Completed or Locked.

Disable buttons/links for locked steps.

PHASE 3 – Typing Exercise UI (Core Frontend Part)

Backend:

Endpoint for fetching exercise content:

GET /exercises/{exercise} returns text + time limit.

Endpoint for posting attempt result:

POST /exercises/{exercise}/attempt

Input: typed text, duration, start_time, end_time (or WPM, accuracy calculated on frontend)

Save exercise_attempts & update step_progress.

Frontend:

Create Typing page (Blade):

Show original text in a fixed area.

Textarea / input for user typing.

Live timer (JS).

Live WPM/accuracy optional, or calculate at end.

On submit:

Disable input, show result.

Call API route with attempt data.

Show “Step Completed” or “Try again” message.

UI enhancements:

Highlight correct/incorrect characters.

Keypress highlight (optional).

PHASE 4 – Badges & Achievements

Backend:

Create badges & user_badges tables.

Define logic inside services or observers:

After step completion → check if all steps in level are done → award level badge.

After X days of continuous activity → award streak badge.

Frontend:

“My Badges” page:

Card layout: badge image + name + description + date.

Public badge page:

Route: /u/{username}/badge/{id}

Shows badge & basic user info.

Include meta tags for nice preview when shared.

Add “Share” button on badge card:

Opens share dialog or prefilled URL for Facebook/LinkedIn.

PHASE 5 – Packages & Paid Levels

Backend:

Create packages, subscriptions, payments tables and models.

Add middleware or helper methods:

userCanAccessLevel($user, $level) checks subscription.

Super Admin routes for managing packages.

Frontend:

“Pricing / Packages” page:

Show package cards: name, levels included, price, duration.

“My Subscription” page:

Show current package, expiry date.

On attempt to open a locked level:

Show message: “This level requires package X. Go to Pricing.”

PHASE 6 – Institutions & Batches

Backend:

Create tables: institutions, batches, batch_user.

Routes & controllers:

Super Admin: manage institutions.

Institution Admin: manage batches and batch-student mapping.

Frontend:

Institution Admin Dashboard:

List of batches

Buttons for “Create batch”, “View batch students”.

Batch detail page:

List students + their progress summary.

Simple charts (later, if needed).

PHASE 7 – Certificates

Backend:

Create certificates table.

Logic:

When a user completes target levels → generate certificate.

Use a PDF library (e.g. dompdf) to generate certificate PDF.

Public route:

/cert/{certificate_code}

Frontend:

My Certificates page:

List of earned certificates.

Download button.

Public certificate page:

Shows user, level, completion date, validity.

PHASE 8 – Contests & Leaderboards (Optional, Next)

You can add this in a second version:

Contest CRUD, participation, leaderboard pages.
